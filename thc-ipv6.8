.SH NAME
thc-ipv6 \- Tools to play with IPv6
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B any-thc-ipv6-tool [-r] other options ...
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-r
Send RAW frames to device (no ethernet frames. this is for tunnels.).
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B thc-ipv6
.PP
.TP
.B parasite6 <interface> [fake-mac]
This is an "ARP spoofer" for IPv6, redirecting all local traffic to your
own system (or nirvana if fake-mac does not exist) by answering falsely
to Neighbor Solitication requests, specifying FAKE-MAC results in a local DOS

.B dos-new-ip6 <interface>
This tools prevents new ipv6 interfaces to come up, by sending answers
to duplicate ip6 checks (DAD). This results in a DOS for new ipv6
devices.

.B detect-new-ip6 <interface> [scriptname]
This tools detects new ipv6 addresses joining the local network.  If
scriptname is supplied, it is executed with the detected IPv6 address as
option

.B fake_router6 [-r] <interface> <router-ip-link-local
network-address/prefix-length> <mtu> [mac-address]
Announce yourself as a router and try to become the default router.  If
a non-existing mac-address is supplied, this results in a DOS.

.B fake_advertise6 <interface> <ip-address> [target-address [own-mac-address]]
Advertise ipv6 address on the network (with own mac if not defined)
sending it to the all-nodes multicast address if no target specified.

.B fake_mld6 [-r] <interface> <multicast-address> [[target-address] [[ttl] [[own-ip] [own-mac-address]]]]
Advertise yourself in a multicast group of your choice.

.B fake_mipv6 [-r] <interface> <home-address> <home-agent-address> <care-of-address>
If the mobile IPv6 home-agent is mis-configured to accept MIPV6 updates without
IPSEC, this will redirect all packets for home-address to care-of-address

.B redir6 [-r] <interface> <src-ip> <target-ip> <original-router> <new-router> [new-router-mac]
Implant a route into src-ip, which redirects all traffic to target-ip to
new-ip. You must know the router which would handle the route.
If the new-router-mac does not exist, this results in a DOS.

.B smurf6 [-r] <interface> <victim-ip> [multicast-network-address]
Smurf the target with icmp echo replies. Target of echo request is the
local all-nodes multicast address if not specified

.B alive6 [-r] <interface> [unicast-or-multicast-address [remote-router]]
Shows alive addresses in the segment. If you specify a remote router, the
packets are sent with a routing header prefixed by fragmentation

.B toobig6 [-r] <interface> <target-ip> <existing-ip> <mtu>
Implants the specified mtu on the target

.B rsmurf6 [-r] <interface> <victim-ip>
Smurfs the local network of the victim. Note: this depends on an
implementation error, currently only verified on Linux (fixed in current versions).
Evil: "ff02::1" as victim will DOS your local LAN completely

.B implementation6 [-r] <interface> <destination> [test-case-number]
Performs some ipv6 implementation checks

.B sendpees6 <interface> <key_length> <prefix> <victim-ip>
Send SEND neighbor solicitation messages and make target to verify a lota CGA and RSA signatures.
